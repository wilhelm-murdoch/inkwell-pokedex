### The Inkwell Pokedex
***

This contains a directory filled with stub articles to be used for testing with [Inkwell](https://github.com/wilhelm-murdoch/inkwell). Simply clone this repository and change the `ARTICLES_FOLDER` configuration directive in Inkwell to point to this list of articles. The server should restart immediately. Just refresh your browser and you should see the test content.

These files were generated by [this Python script](https://gist.github.com/wilhelm-murdoch/6038159).
